                    Our Earth is so beautiful.
                    There, are a lot of blue
                    rivers and lakes on the Earth. Its oceans are full
                    of wonders. There are high mountains covered with
                    snow and wonderful fields and forests full of different
                    plants and animals. The sun shines high up in the
                    blue sky. At night we can see the moon and millions
                    of stars. One season comes after another and brings
                    changes in weather and nature. There are so many
                    wonderful places to visit and interesting things
                    to see. Nature gives people its riches to live and enjoy.
                    We can’t live without fresh air, clean water, sunshine and
                    a lot of things which we take from the nature. That's
                    why we must take care of it. We must keep our rivers
                    and lakes, forests and towns clean. We must take care
                    of each plant and each animal. We must plant flowers
                    — not pick them up, feed birds and animals in winter
                    — not kill them. Then we'll be happy to live on the
                    most beautiful planet in the Universe. </p>

                    Britain is famous all over the world for its gardens, 
                    dogs, villages, buses, cars, private schools, 
                    the Queen, sports like football and cricket, 
                    Parliament. However, not so much has been written 
                    about the wonderful food that can be found in Britain. 
                    Read two texts about food and say what the English eat 
                    and what the British food is like. Is there any 
                    difference between the English and the British food? 
                    The texts are for beginners and for the upper-intermediate 
                    level.
                    <p class="theme_text">
                        For breakfast English people often have porridge 
                        with milk and sugar. They don’t eat much bread. 
                        They usually have toasts. They enjoy drinking strong 
                        tea with milk.
                        At one o’clock English people have lunch. They 
                        usually have lunch in a restaurant or a cafe.

                        On a warm sunny day you can see people under the

                        English people don’t eat much soup. There is only 
                        one kind of soup on the menu: onion (луковый), 
                        tomato (томатный) or mushroom (грибной).

                        Five o’clock tea is a national habit. English

                        The English people drink little coffee. Tea is

                <p class="theme_text">
                    I have always been a big fan of music but to be 
                    honest, I don't know anyone who has ever overtly 
                    disliked it. And that’s why it’s one of life's 
                    true delights, because it can be enjoyed by 
                    anyone and everyone. With films, you need to 
                    understand what is being said and with books, 
                    you need to be able to read, but music has no 
                    boundaries, no prerequisites and is accessible 
                    for all. I don’t think there are many things in 
                    life that have such a direct and visible impact 
                    on someone’s mood. Obviously there are some people 
                    who are less bothered by music, and of course it 
                    depends on what sort of music they’re into, but 
                    watching someone react when they hear one of their 
                    favourite songs is actually the best thing ever.

                    Personally, I’m a big disco/soul/funk kind of girl. 
                    I like to just call it boogie music because for me,
                    I don’t see how you can’t not dance when you 
                    hear it. It instantly changes my mood and you 
                    can see it in my face straight away (I’m that 
                    idiot bounding down the street with their headphones 
                    on and a great big smile on their face). But I 
                    don’t care, because music makes me feel good and 
                    has the power to join you with other people in 
                    this shared moment where exchanging words isn’t
                    necessary.
